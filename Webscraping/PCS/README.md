# Web Scraping Example with BeautifulSoup

This repository contains an example script for web scraping using **BeautifulSoup**. The script demonstrates how to retrieve and parse data from a web page.

```bash
pip install requests
```

The `scrape_rider.py` script demonstrates basic web scraping, including:

- Sending HTTP requests to retrieve web pages.
- Parsing the HTML content using BeautifulSoup.
- Extracting specific data from the page (e.g., text, links, or tables).

### Usage

2. Navigate to the directory where `scrape_rider.py` is located.
3. Run the script by typing:
