## What is Web Scraping?

Web scraping is the process of extracting data from websites using automated scripts. Instead of manually copying and pasting information, web scraping allows users to retrieve and process large amounts of data efficiently. This is typically done using libraries such as **BeautifulSoup** and **Scrapy** in Python.

## Why is Web Scraping Useful?

Web scraping is widely used for various applications, including:

- **Data Collection & Analysis** – Gathering large datasets from the web for research, business intelligence, and machine learning.
- **Price Monitoring** – Tracking prices of products on e-commerce websites for competitive analysis.
- **News & Content Aggregation** – Collecting articles, headlines, or blog posts from different sources in one place.
- **Lead Generation** – Extracting business contacts or emails from directories.
- **Stock Market & Finance** – Retrieving financial data, stock prices, and company reports for investment analysis.
- **Job Listings & Market Research** – Scraping job portals to analyze hiring trends and salary benchmarks.

## Ethical Considerations

While web scraping is a powerful tool, it is essential to follow ethical and legal guidelines:

- **Respect `robots.txt`** – Many websites specify scraping rules in a `robots.txt` file.
- **Avoid Overloading Servers** – Sending too many requests in a short time can slow down a website or get your IP blocked.
- **Use APIs When Available** – Some websites provide public APIs, which are the preferred way to access data.

By following best practices, web scraping can be a valuable tool for data-driven decision-making in various fields.
